Responsive Web Design

 

Responsive Overview:

 

Responsive web design is the practice of building a website suitable to work on every device and every screen size, no matter how large or small, mobile or desktop. Responsive web design is focused around providing an intuitive and gratifying experience for everyone. Desktop computer and cell phone users alike all benefit from responsive websites.

 

 

Responsive vs. Adaptive vs. Mobile:

 

Responsive and adaptive web design are closely related, and often transposed as one in the same. Responsive generally means to react quickly and positively to any change, while adaptive means to be easily modified for a new purpose or situation, such as change. With responsive design websites continually and fluidly change based on different factors, such as viewport width, while adaptive websites are built to a group of preset factors. A combination of the two is ideal, providing the perfect formula for functional websites. Which term is used specifically doesn’t make a huge difference. Mobile, on the other hand, generally means to build a separate website commonly on a new domain solely for mobile users. 

 

Currently the most popular technique lies within responsive web design, favoring design that dynamically adapts to different browser and device viewports, changing layout and content along the way. 

 

1- Flexible Layouts: the practice of building the layout of a website with a flexible grid, capable of dynamically resizing to any width. 

 

2- Flexible Grid: are built using relative length units, most commonly percentages or em units.

 

Relative Viewport Lengths. 

 

CSS3 introduced some new relative length units, specifically related to the viewport size of the browser or device:

 

- vw: Viewports width. 

- vh: Viewports height. 

- vmin: Minimum of the viewport’s height and width. 

- vmax: Maximum of the viewport’s height and width. 

 

3- Media Queries: provide the ability to specify different styles for individual browser and device circumstances, the width of the viewport or device orientation for example.

 

- Initializing Media Queries: There are a couple different ways to use media queries, using the @media rule inside of an existing style sheet, importing a new style sheet using the @import rule, or by linking to a separate style sheet from within the HTML document.

 

- Logical Operators in Media Queries: Logical operators in media queries help build powerful expressions. There are three different logical operators available for use within media queries, including and, not, and only.

 

- Media Features in Media Queries: identify what attributes or properties will be targeted within the media query expression. 

 

- Height & Width Media Features: One of the most common media features revolves around determining a height or width for a device or browser viewport.

 

- Orientation Media Feature: determines if a device is in the landscape or portrait orientation. The landscape mode is triggered when the display is wider than taller, and the portrait mode is triggered when the display is taller than wider.

 

- Aspect Ratio Media Features: The aspect-ratio and device-aspect-ratio features specifies the width/height pixel ratio of the targeted rendering area or output device.

 

- Resolution Media Feature: specifies the resolution of the output device in pixel density, also known as dots per inch or DPI.

 

Mobile First: One popular technique with using media queries is called mobile first. The mobile first approach includes using styles targeted at smaller viewports as the default styles for a website, then use media queries to add styles as the viewport grows.

 

- Viewport: Mobile devices generally do a pretty decent job of displaying websites these days.

 

- Flexible Media: As viewports begin to change size media doesn’t always follow suit. Images, videos, and other media types need to be scalable, changing their size as the size of the viewport changes.

 

 

What is Float:

 

Float is a CSS positioning property. To understand its purpose and origin, we can look to print design. In a print layout, images may be set into the page such that text wraps around them as needed. This is commonly and appropriately called “text wrap”.

 

 

What's are floats used for:

 

Floats are also helpful for layout in smaller instances. Take for example this little area of a web page. 

 

Clearing the float:

 

Float’s sister property is clear. An element that has the clear property set on it will not move up adjacent to the float like the float desires, but will move itself down past the float. 

 

The great collapse: One of the more bewildering things about working with floats is how they can affect the element that contains them (their “parent” element). If this parent element contained nothing but floated elements, the height of it would literally collapse to nothing. This isn’t always obvious if the parent doesn’t contain any visually noticeable background, but it is important to be aware of.

 

- Techniques for clearing floats: 

 

1- The Empty Div Method. 

2- The Overflow Method. 

3- The Easy Clearing Method. 

 

Problems with floats:

 

1- Push down. 

2- Double Margin Bug. 

3- The 3px Jog is when text that is up next to a floated element is mysteriously kicked away by 3px like a weird forcefield around the float.

4- In IE 7, the Bottom Margin Bug is when if a floated parent has floated children inside it, bottom margin on those children is ignored by the parent.
