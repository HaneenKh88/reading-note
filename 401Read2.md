## Differences between PUT and PATCH
The main difference between PUT and PATCH requests is witnessed in the way the server processes the enclosed entity to update the resource identified by the Request-URI. When making a PUT request, the enclosed entity is viewed as the modified version of the resource saved on the original server, and the client is requesting to replace it. However, with PATCH, the enclosed entity boasts a set of instructions that describe how a resource stored on the original server should be partially modified to create a new version.

The second difference is when it comes to idempotency. HTTP PUT is said to be idempotent since it always yields the same results every after making several requests. On the other hand, HTTP PATCH is basically said to be non-idempotent. However, it can be made to be idempotent based on where it is implemented.

 

Three services or tools that allow to “mock” an API for development:

1 – Nock (Links to an external site.).
2 – MockServer (Links to an external site.).
3 – Beeceptor (Links to an external site.).
 

## Compare and contrast Swagger and APIDoc.js 1 Which HTTP status codes should be sent with each type of (un)successful API call?

Informational responses (100–199)
Successful responses (200–299)
Redirects (300–399)
Client errors (400–499)
Server errors (500–599)
 

## Compare and contrast SOAP and ReST:

Deciding Between SOAP and REST
Unless you plan to create your own web service, the decision of which protocol to use may already be made for you. Extremely few web services, such as Amazon, support both. The focus of your decision often centers on which web service best meets your needs, rather than which protocol to use.


Soap Advantages

SOAP provides the following advantages when compared to REST:
•    Language, platform, and transport independent (REST requires use of HTTP)
•    Works well in distributed enterprise environments (REST assumes direct point-to-point communication)
•    Standardized
•    Provides significant pre-build extensibility in the form of the WS* standards
•    Built-in error handling
•    Automation when used with certain language products

REST Advantages

REST is easier to use for the most part and is more flexible. It has the following advantages over SOAP:
•    No expensive tools require to interact with the web service
•    Smaller learning curve
•    Efficient (SOAP uses XML for all messages, REST can use smaller message formats)
•    Fast (no extensive processing required)
•    Closer to other web technologies in design philosophy

 

## web server:

is server software, or a system of one or more computers dedicated to running this software, that can satisfy client HTTP requests on the public World Wide Web or also on private LANs and WANs.

 

## Express:

is a back end web application framework for Node.js, released as free and open-source software under the MIT License. It is designed for building web applications and APIs. It has been called the de facto standard server framework for Node.js.

 

## Routing:

is the process of selecting a path for traffic in a network or between or across multiple networks. Broadly, routing is performed in many types of networks, including circuit-switched networks, such as the public switched telephone network (PSTN), and computer networks, such as the Internet.

 

## WRRC: 

cycle of requests and responses that flow between clients and servers.
