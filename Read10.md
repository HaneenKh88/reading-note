Chapter 10 - Error Handling & Debugging

When writing a long script, nobody gets everything right in their first attempt. The error messages that a browser gives look cryptic at first, but they can help you determine what went wrong in your JavaScript and how to fix it.

- There are seven types of built-in error objects in JavaScript. You'll see them on the next two pages:

1- Error: Generic error - the other errors 
are all based upon this error. 

2- Syntax Error: Syntax has not been followed. 

3- Reference Error: Tried to reference a variable that is not declared/within scope. 

4- Type Error: An unexpected data type that cannot be coerced. 

5- Range Error: Numbers not in acceptable range. 

6- URI Error: encodeURI()
.decodeURI(),and similar methods used incorrectly. 

7- Eval Error: eva l() function used incorrectly. 


Now that you know what an error is and how the browser treats them, there are two things you can do with the errors:

1- Debug The Script To Fix Errors: If you come across an error while writing a script (or when someone reports a bug), you will need to debug the code, track down the source of the error, and fix it. 

2- Handle Errors Gracefully: You can handle errors gracefully using try, catch, 
throw, and finally statements.


- If you understand execution contexts (which have two stages) and stacks, you are more likely to find the error in your code. 

- Debugging is the process of finding errors. It involves a process of deduction.

- The console helps narrow down the area in which the error is located, so you can try to find the exact error. 

- JavaScript has 7 different types of errors. Each creates its own error object, which can tell you its line number and gives a description of the error. 

- If you know that you may get an error, you can handle it gracefully using the try, catch, finally statements.
