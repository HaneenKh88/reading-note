Chapter 3 - Lists: 

We have four types of lists:

- Ordered list (show the list in numbers oreder).

- Un ordered list (show the list without numbers).

- Definition list (to contain series of terms and thir definitions).

- Nested Lists (to devide the list into sub in orderd lists).

Chapter 13 - Boxes:

- CSS treat every HTML elements as individual box.

- I can use different attributes of styling for each element of the HTML page, Such as:

1- Box Dimensions (width, height).
2- Limiting Width (min width, max width). 
3- Limiting Height (min height, max height). 
4- Overflowing (tell the browsers what to do if the content larger than box). 
5- Border (box border on the content). 
6- Margin (space between the boxes or the text). 
7- Padding (space between text and border). 
8- Display ( have four ways of displaying the element: 1- inline. 2- none 3- inline block. 4- block). 
9- Visability (have only tow ways: 1- Visabile. 2- Hidden). 
10- border image (border around the image). 
11- Box shadow (gives shadow to to the box I created). 
12- Border radius (make the border as circle). 

Chapter 2 - Basic Java Script Instruction:

- We use Java Script to give the browser instructions to follow. 
- The script is made of a series of statements and each of it as step have the browsers to follow. 
- We use the variables to store a piece of information to use it in the code. 
- Arrays are special types of variables that's store more than piece of information. 
- Java Script can distinguish between all data types without identifying the data type of the variable. 
- We use expressions to evaluate into one value after compare between more than one value using conditions or loops conditions, and it's depend on operators to calculate a value. 

Chapter 4 - Decisions and Loops:

To take a decision we can go with more than one path and this means the browser run the code in different locations with different situations, to determine the path we take its depends on three concepts: 

1- Evaluations: evaluate the value to check if it's match the expected result. 

2- Decision: using the result to select the path. 

3- Loops: using it as counter while we get the same excpected result. 

We using the Comparison operator to compare between two values or variable and the result well be boolean value which be true or false and these operators are:

- Equal to (==) should be same. 
- Not Equal to (! =) should not be the same value. 
- Strict Equal to (===) should be the same value and datatype. 
- Not Strict Equal to (! ==) should not be the same value and datatype. 
- Grater than (>) should the value be grater than the other value. 
- Grater than or equal (>=) should the value be grater than or aqual to the other value.  
- Less than (<) should the value be less than the other value. 
- Less than or equal (<=) should the value be less than or equal the other value. 

To put more than condition using the Comparison operator we using the logical operator which there are:

- Logical and (&&) should be both of the conditions true. 
- Logical or (||) could be one of the conditions true.  
- Logical Not (!) it's take the reverse of the result. 

When we need to use code more than once we put it in loop counters, which they are:

- foor loop, which is used single code in in it and execute multiple times based on the number of counters that I specified. 

- while loop, it's a condition loop that's could used to get the result while the condition result is true. 

Types of loops:

- for loops (is counter loop). 
- while loop (is condition loop). 
- do while loop (same of while but the different is the starment come before condition).
