The computer change the world, we used it in everywhere. Our home, work, backet, on rist, back bag and every place or community you will need to use it.

But are you wondering how this computer work? What's make computer a computer? How the computer information represented inside the computer as electricity? How computer use circuits to do everything from simple math to simulation in the virtual world? How software controlled in hardware 

The computer contains from 4 main parts:

1- CPU.
2- Memory.
3- Input.
4- Output.

In the human beginning they used a manual tools to help them in make a something suits our needs or solves their problems, and If the designed machine help with thinking work?

These machine manipulate information inside it to get us the required output with different tasks which is:

1- Input.
2- Storage.
3- processing.
4- Output.

It's common to all computers and that's elwhat make computer a computer.

The information is represented inside the computer as 0's 1's language and called binary language because it's depend on two options which is (on , of), (true, false) to store the information inside the computer. Also the binary system is using in circut.

As example when I write a word in the computer, this word well processed it in the cpu as 0's, 1's bit then stored in the memory after that we'll get the physical required output.

The hardware parts (such as screen, wires, mouse, keyboard... etc) in the computer is something physical that's controlled by software programs (such as applications, games, websites... etc) its running depends on the programming code.
