Chapter 7 - Forms:

Traditionally, the term 'form' has referred to a printed document that contains 
spaces for you to fill in information.

- HTML borrows the concept of a form to refer to different elements that allow you to collect information from visitors to 
your site.



- Whenever you want to collect information from visitors you will need a form, which lives inside a <form> element.

- Information from a form is sent in name/value pairs.
- Each form control is given a name, and the text the user types in or the values of the options they select are sent to the server.

- HTML5 introduces new form elements which make it easier for visitors to fill in forms.
