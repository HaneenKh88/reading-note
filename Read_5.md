CSS is shortcut for Cascading Style Sheet, and we use it to style our page on the website inside HTML open tag.

CSS deal with each HTML element as if it appears inside its own box and uses rules to indicate how that element should look.

The rules in CSS are made by selector which specified what of the HTML Page element should be applied on it. 

Declarations are made up of two parts which is:

- the properties of the element that you want to change it. 
- the values of those properties. 

We can use different ways to style my HTML page which is:

- in line style: means that we applied the style rules inside the HTML tags. 

- external style: which create a CSS file and link it to the HTML file. 

- selector: is a property in CSS to select or applied a style on different HTML tags in the same block by giving it an ID or group it in a class. 

Coloris is really bring a life into the website and it's a important part of styling the website, So we have different parts to coloring in my HTML page:

- Foreground color (colorized the font of my HTML page). 

- Background color (colorized the background of the paragraph or head lines.. etc). 

We have different ways to specify the color of any part in my HTML page:

- RGB Values. 
- Hex Codes. 
- Color Names. 
- HUE. 
- Saturation. 
- Brightness. 

- we can specify the opacity of the color by RGBA. 

- the colors HUE, Saturation and Brightness called HSL colors.
