We using the Comparison operator to compare between two values or variable and the result well be boolean value which be true or false and these operators are:

- Equal to (==) should be same. 
- Not Equal to (! =) should not be the same value. 
- Strict Equal to (===) should be the same value and datatype. 
- Not Strict Equal to (! ==) should not be the same value and datatype. 
- Grater than (>) should the value be grater than the other value. 
- Grater than or equal (>=) should the value be grater than or aqual to the other value.  
- Less than (<) should the value be less than the other value. 
- Less than or equal (<=) should the value be less than or equal the other value. 

To put more than condition using the Comparison operator we using the logical operator which there are:

- Logical and (&&) should be both of the conditions true. 
- Logical or (||) could be one of the conditions true.  
- Logical Not (!) it's take the reverse of the result. 

When we need to use code more than once we put it in loop counters, which they are:

- foor loop, which is used single code in in it and execute multiple times based on the number of counters that I specified. 

- while loop, it's a condition loop that's could used to get the result while the condition result is true.
