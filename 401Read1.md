# Array.prototype.map()
The map() method creates a new array populated with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array.

 

# Array.prototype.reduce()
The reduce() method executes a reducer function (that you provide) on each element of the array, resulting in single output value.

 

# superagent:

superagent
  .post('/api/pet')
  .send({ name: 'Manny', species: 'cat' }) // sends a JSON post body
  .set('X-API-Key', 'foobar')
  .set('accept', 'json')
  .end((err, res) => {
    // Calling the end function will send the request
  });
promise with then/catch:
 superagent.post('/api/pet').then(console.log).catch(console.error);

 

# promise with async/await:

(async () => {
  try {
    const res = await superagent.post('/api/pet');
    console.log(res);
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(err);
  }
})();



# Promise:
The Promise object represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.

 

A Promise is a proxy for a value not necessarily known when the promise is created. It allows you to associate handlers with an asynchronous action's eventual success value or failure reason. This lets asynchronous methods return values like synchronous methods: instead of immediately returning the final value, the asynchronous method returns a promise to supply the value at some point in the future.

A Promise is in one of these states:

pending: initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected.
fulfilled: meaning that the operation was completed successfully.
rejected: meaning that the operation failed.
 

# Are all callback functions considered to be Asynchronous? Why or Why Not?

Well, basically yes, but there's a catch. Every asynchronous function takes a function argument, but not every function that does so is asynchronous. It matters how the argument is used inside the function.

 

Argument function can be called synchronously
Simply taking a callback doesn't make a function asynchronous. There are many examples of functions that take a function argument but are not asynchronous. For example there's forEach in Array. It iterates over each item and calls the function once per item.

This can be used among other things to calculate total value from a property of each item

  let totalSize = 0;
  items.forEach((item) => {
    totalSize += item.size;
  });
  return totalSize;
Calling the argument function is performed as part of normal step-by-step sequential execution of statements that make up the forEach implementation. Throwing an exception in the argument function would reveal a stack trace containing forEach and your function nested inside it.

It is very important to forEach to operate this way. If the argument function would be called asynchronously, code like in the example would not work as expected. The results would be zero each time.

Asynchronous function needs to perform an asynchronous operation
For a function to be asynchronous it needs to perform an asynchronous operation. It needs to incorporate the argument callback in handling the results of this asynchronous operation. Only this way the function becomes asynchronous.

For example a function reading contents of a file with the correct encoding can be implemented as an asynchronous function.

function readFileAsUtf8(filename, callback) {
  fs.readFile(filename, "utf8", (err, data) => {
    callback(data);
  });
}
Your callback will not be called as part of the execution of readFileAsUtf8 function. It will be called only after the file contents have been read at some point in the future. It will be called asynchronously.

Throwing an exception from your callback would reveal a short stack trace originating from the event loop. It would not contain any mention of the function that originally took the function as an argument.
