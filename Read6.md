Chapter 3 - Object Literals:

- Objects group together a set of variables and functions to create a model of a something you would recognize from the real world. In an object, variables and functions take on new names. 

 In object: 

1- Variables become known as properties.

2- Functions become known as methods.

Syntax for creating object and access to it:

Var var name = {

Set of variables;
. 
. 
. 

Set of functions
. 
. 
. 

}

How we can access to the variable inside the object:

Var varname = object name. Variable name.

Chapter 5 - Document Object Model:

The Document Object Model (DOM) specifies how browsers should create a model of an HTML page and how JavaScript can access and update the 
contents of a web page while it is in the browser window. 

1- The browser represents the page using a DOM tree. 

2- DOM trees have four types of nodes:

- document nodes. 
- element nodes. 
- attribute nodes. 
- text nodes.

3- I can select element nodes by their ID or class attributes, by tag name, or using CSS selector syntax. 

4- Whenever a DOM query can return more than one node, it will always return a Nodel List. 

5- I can access and update the element node content using properties such as textContent and innerHTML or using DOM manipulation techniques. 

6- element node can contain multiple text nodes and child elements that are siblings of each other. 

7- Browsers offer tools for viewing the DOM tree.
