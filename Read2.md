How we can add a markup to the text that's appear in my page?

 

We can add a markup to the text in two levels:

 

1- Structural Markup: elements can used to describe both headings and paragraphs. 

 

2- Semantic Markup: which provide extra information. 

 

HTML elements use for descripe the structure of the as headings, subheadings and paragraphs. 

 

CSS used to controlling the page style and how the page structure will shows. 

 

 

CSS deal with each HTML element as if it appears inside its own box and uses rules to indicate how that element should look.

 

The rules in CSS are made by selector which specified what of the HTML Page element should be applied on it. 

 

Declarations are made up of two parts which is:

 

- the properties of the element that you want to change it. 

- the values of those properties. 

 

We can use different ways to style my HTML page which is:

 

- in line style: means that we applied the style rules inside the HTML tags. 

 

- external style: which create a CSS file and link it to the HTML file. 

 

- selector: is a property in CSS to select or applied a style on different HTML tags in the same block by giving it an ID or group it in a class and they made the roles for rules. 

 

Coloris is really bring a life into the website and it's a important part of styling the website, So we have different parts to coloring in my HTML page:

 

- Foreground color (colorized the font of my HTML page). 

 

- Background color (colorized the background of the paragraph or head lines.. etc). 

 

We have different ways to specify the color of any part in my HTML page:

 

- RGB Values. 

- Hex Codes. 

- Color Names. 

- HUE. 

- Saturation. 

- Brightness. 

 

- we can specify the opacity of the color by RGBA. 

 

- the colors HUE, Saturation and Brightness called HSL colors. 

 

In Javascript we write instructions that's your website should follow. It's a series of statements that's executed to get interactive website. 

 

We use the variables to store a specific date in the script such as (number, string, boolean and others data types can stored int the variables), comments used for descripe the code steps to help any one understand the code, the arrays used for store a list of data in one array, we also used expressions to evaluate the results in single value, we can assign one value to it or multiple value connected with an operator such as (+, -, /, *). 

 

We can use the operators for a 3 ways which is:

 

- Arithmetic operators. 

- String operators. 

- Condition operators. 

 

 

 

We throw in 3 stage in loops:

 

- Evaluation (analyze value to check if match the expression). 

- Decision (after get the result we take decision to any path we should take). 

- Loops (if I want to repeat the expression many times). 

 

We using the Comparison operator to compare between two values or variable and the result well be boolean value which be true or false and these operators are:

 

- Equal to (==) should be same. 

- Not Equal to (! =) should not be the same value. 

- Strict Equal to (===) should be the same value and datatype. 

- Not Strict Equal to (! ==) should not be the same value and datatype. 

- Grater than (>) should the value be grater than the other value. 

- Grater than or equal (>=) should the value be grater than or aqual to the other value.  

- Less than (<) should the value be less than the other value. 

- Less than or equal (<=) should the value be less than or equal the other value. 

 

To put more than condition using the Comparison operator we using the logical operator which there are:

 

- Logical and (&&) should be both of the conditions true. 

- Logical or (||) could be one of the conditions true.  

- Logical Not (!) it's take the reverse of the result. 

 

When we need to use code more than once we put it in loop counters, which they are:

 

- foor loop, which is used single code in in it and execute multiple times based on the number of counters that I specified. 

 

- while loop, it's a condition loop that's could used to get the result while the condition result is true. 

 

Types of loops:

 

- for loops (is counter loop). 

- while loop (is condition loop). 

- do while loop (same of while but the different is the starment come before condition).
