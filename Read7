Domain Modeling : Domain modeling is the process of creating a conceptual model in code for a specific problem.

- An entity that stores data in properties and encapsulates behaviors in methods is commonly referred to as an object-oriented model.

- a domain model that's articulated well can verify and validate your understanding of that problem. 

- When modeling a single entity that'll have many instances, build self-contained objects with the same attributes and behaviors.

- Model its attributes with a constructor function that defines and initializes properties.

- Model its behaviors with small methods that focus on doing one job well.

- Create instances using the new keyword followed by a call to a constructor function.

- Store the newly created object in a variable so you can access its properties and methods from outside.

- Use the this variable within methods so you can access the object's properties and methods from inside.

Chapter 6 - tables:

- A table represents the information in a grid format. 

- Examples of tables include:

1- financial reports.
2- TV. 
3- schedules. 
4- sports results. 

Table HTML tags:
- <table> : create the table structure. 
- <th> : create the table head. 
- <tr> : create a row in the table. 
- <td> : create cells that I can to fill the table information in it. 

- You can make cells of a table span more than one row or column using the rowspan and colspan attributes.

- For long tables you can split the table into a <thead>, <tbody>, and <tfoot>.

Chapter 3 - Functions, methods and objects:

Programmers use functions, methods, and objects to organize their code. 

1- Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements). 

Syntax:

function Name () 
{
Statements. 
Return;
} ;

Calling:

function name (the value of the parameters if they founds) ;

2- Objects group together a set of variables and functions to create a model of a something you would recognize from the real world. In an object, variables and functions take on new names. 

Syntax:

Var name = {
Var name: value;
. 
. 
etc

Function name: function () 
{
Return this.variable 
} 
} 

Accessing:

Var name = object name. Variable name.

Create objects:

Var name = new objectname (parameters if it's found). 

3- Methods are same as functions.

- Functions can take parameters (informatiorJ required to do their job) and may return a value. 

- An object is a series of variables and functions that represent something from the world around you. 

- In an object, variables are known as properties of the object; functions are known as methods of the object. 

- Web browsers implement objects that represent both the browser window and the document loaded into the browser window. 

- JavaScript also has several built-in objects such as String, Number, Math, and Date. Their properties and methods offer functionality that help you write scripts. 

- Arrays and objects can be used to create complex data sets (and both can contain the other).
